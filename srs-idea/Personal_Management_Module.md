## Personal Management Module (Concept Overview)

The Personal Management module is envisioned as a system for managing various types of personnel, including internal operators, volunteers, and professionals such as police, army, and fire service members. This module could serve as the primary tool for resource mobilization and management during disaster events. Deployable personnel would be listed in a database containing critical information such as **last known location, skills, certifications, age, blood group, contact numbers, availability, and more**. Given the importance of this data for decision-making, it would be crucial to **update it before the disaster season** to ensure accuracy.

The module could include advanced algorithms to form response teams based on Standard Operating Procedures (SoP) and the specific requirements of an event. Integration with other modules would be possible as needed. While a general overview of this data might be accessible to the public, detailed information would need to be **securely protected due to its sensitive nature**.

Given the critical importance of this information, the module would require **secure handling and restricted access**. All actions within this module should be **auditable** to support future analysis. Audit trails would be maintained following SoP guidelines to facilitate both internal and external audits.
