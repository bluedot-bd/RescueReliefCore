## Disaster Tracking Module (Concept Overview)

The Disaster Tracking module is envisioned as a system to monitor and respond to disaster events across various administrative levels, from villages to divisions. The module could integrate data from **IoT** devices to track river water levels and collect rain data from weather sources automatically. In addition to IoT inputs, public reports about ongoing disaster situations, including details on **temperature, electricity, water supply, drinking water availability, mobile network coverage, broadband status, and dam conditions**, could be submitted via mobile apps, websites, or call centers.

These reports would trigger a preliminary disaster alert, which would then be reviewed and validated by a central team. The team would categorize the event based on severity and initiate appropriate actions as per a **Standard Operating Procedure (SoP)**. The idea is that reports should be made available publicly without identifying the reporter, and disaster data should be visualized on both public and internal platforms using open-source GIS maps. The module could also allow the central team to create disaster events independently, without waiting for public reports.

Event status updates, including escalation or de-escalation, would be managed based on ongoing field reports and SoP guidelines. All actions taken in response to disaster events would be documented and displayed for public and internal review. Event closures would be based on both public input and the central teamâ€™s decision.

*This concept requires further data and refinement to ensure its feasibility and effectiveness.* **All aspects suggested here would be considered essential to the module's operation.**
